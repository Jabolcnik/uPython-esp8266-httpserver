# uPython-esp8266-httpserver

This is a General Purpose http server for ESP8266 written in uPython

It should be a temperature web server
For devices like ESP8266 and with temperature sensors based on DS18b20. 

Actually it does not have enough memory to fully run and it hangs pretty soon or have no memory for the temp sensor class

I should not use bootstrap but actually it is useful to resize for smartphones and basically I WANT IT!

ANYWAY:

- the http server is general purpose and is easy to customize

- to develop the Makefile is pretty powerful and automatize upload and reset by means of espsend.py which should be installed or configured in the proper directory

- It uses other tools such as webrepl
